# Register no. 212223220069
# Aim: To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT - To demonstrate how to create a prompt-based application to organize daily tasks, showing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

# AI Tools Required: 
Lovable AI


# Explanation: 
Prompt:
"Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time."
Procedure:
1. Define the core requirements of a personal productivity assistant.
2. Identify and construct appropriate prompts for each task using an LLM (e.g., ChatGPT).
3. Simulate natural user interaction through a simple interface or command-line system.
4. Collect feedback or inputs from users and adapt responses accordingly.
5. (Optional) Integrate basic memory to simulate preference adaptation.
EXPECTED OUTPUT: - (attached the drive link)
Output (Example Response by LLM):
Personal Productivity Assistant Features:
1. Daily Task Manager:
o Accept tasks via natural language (e.g., "Remind me to call mom at 6 PM").
o Organize tasks by priority and deadline.
o Provide daily summaries and pending items.
2. Smart Scheduler:
o Schedule events and set reminders using contextual understanding.
o Notify user of overlapping appointments or free time slots.
3. Wellness Tips Generator:
o Suggest daily wellness advice (hydration, exercise, screen-time breaks).
o Adapt suggestions based on past user preferences and responses.

### 💬 Example Interactions

**Input:** Remind me to call mom at 6 PM  
**Response:** Got it, Niranjani! I’ll remind you to call mom at 6 PM ☎️  

**Input:** Add a 2-hour study session tomorrow at 4 PM  
**Response:** Added a study block tomorrow 4 – 6 PM. Reminder set 15 min before 💪  

**Input:** List my tasks for today  
**Response:** Here’s what’s on your plate 📝  
1️⃣ Call mom – 6 PM  
2️⃣ Study session – 4 PM  
You’re doing great! ✨  

**Input:** I feel tired  
**Response:** 🌿 Take a 10-min walk and sip some water. A short stretch will boost your focus!  

---

### 🧠 Memory Simulation
- Keep a temporary list of tasks and schedules during the chat session.
- When user says “list my tasks” or “delete a reminder,” recall from current session memory.
- Do **not** fabricate completed tasks; only show those added this session.

---

### 🪄 Behavior Rules
- Always extract **ACTION**, **TIME**, **PRIORITY** from natural sentences before confirming.  
- Stay warm, concise, and natural (≤ 3 emojis per message).  
- Ask clarifying questions if input is unclear.  
- Vary tone between friendly → motivational → empathetic depending on context.  
- Never sound robotic; behave like a real assistant.

### 🚀 Opening Message
Hey Niranjani 👋! I’m Asha, your productivity buddy.  
Want me to start with tasks, your schedule, or a quick wellness tip today?
